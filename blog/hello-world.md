# Hello, World, again

This is not the first time I build a personal/business website, swear to god :).

Actually, it's kind of funny to me to think in all the times I have remake my website, and this time my proposal is totally different, you now can be part of my blog too, you can now create entries, stylesheets and more.

It's deployed from my repo so you can contribute however you consider and want to, you and your contribution are always welcomed here.

In the other hand, I decided to show three of my most developed sides, as a person with several interests and abilities, I cannot stay doing just one thing, sorry, I would like to.

Now you are going to be able to see areas of my life I didn't share before, hopefully you like it.
